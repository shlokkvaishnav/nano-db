# Related work: what is actually unclaimed

This document positions the finding in `research/replica_recall/` against
published work. It exists to keep the project honest: the claims here are
narrower than the ones that first suggested themselves, and the last section
lists the things we must **not** say because someone else already owns them.

**Refreshed 2026-09-06 (#55, PR pending).** This document was written in August
2026 around `research/replica_recall/` alone and predates the Qdrant and
Weaviate legs. That pass resolved an internal contradiction about which claim is
sharpest, added the replica-vs-aggregate result and the prior art that bounds
it, folded in what #52 found about the detector, and re-ran the scooping check
(§9). Two new citations were added and one framing risk with them.

**Status of the citations.** Gathered by literature search in August 2026, then
independently verified against source — every arXiv ID resolves and matches its
claimed content, but one citation (ClickHouse #104674, previously the lead
production-evidence item) turned out to be a self-retracted bug report and has
been removed rather than softened; see §6. Two smaller corrections — an
overstated "ground-truth-free" claim (§5, entry 11) and a misattributed author
on the STTT citation (§1) — are marked inline where they occur. Still worth a
second read before external submission, particularly the 2026 entries, which
are recent enough that their own claims may still move.

## The claim

An exact key-value store that loses a row returns *not found*. That is an
observable event, and a Jepsen-family checker can flag it.

An approximate nearest-neighbour index that loses vectors still returns *k*
plausible neighbours. Nothing about the response says anything is wrong.
**Approximation converts data loss into silence.**

Measured on nano-db (2 shards × 3 replicas, node-kill chaos, five seeds,
`--dist lowdim`):

| | baseline | chaos |
|---|---|---|
| within-shard recall spread | 0.0001 ± 0.0002 | 0.0603 ± 0.0269 |
| `index_recall` (graph quality) | 0.9916 ± 0.0030 | 0.9718 ± 0.0097 |
| `completeness` (data content) | 1.0000 ± 0.0000 | 0.9615 ± 0.0143 |

All at the exact Mann-Whitney floor for 5v5, p = 0.0079. After chaos stops and
the cluster fully recovers, `miss@stop == miss@end` in 5/5 runs — **0% of the
lost vectors come back**. Independently built replicas agree to 1e-4, so ANN
nondeterminism contributes essentially nothing to the divergence.

---

## Per-area findings

### 1. Correctness criteria for replicated approximate indexes — **GAP**

The strongest part of the claim. Nothing found formalises what "correct" means
for a replicated ANN index.

The closest prior art, and the one this must be built on top of, is
**Wang et al., *Towards Reliable Vector Database Management Systems: A Software
Testing Roadmap for 2030*** (arXiv:2502.20812, Feb 2025). It names the *oracle
problem* for vector databases explicitly — ANN's nondeterministic ε-error bounds
render boolean assertions ineffective, and differential testing cannot separate
a bug from an expected approximation. It categorises 79+ bugs across Milvus,
Qdrant, Chroma and Weaviate.

It is also a gift, because **it never discusses replication, node failure, fault
injection, or distributed consistency.** It states the problem in the single-node
setting and leaves the replicated setting open. That is exactly the seam this
work sits in.

**Formal lineage:** quasi-linearizability (Afek, Korland & Yanovsky, OPODIS 2010;
verification in Adhikari et al., STTT 2015/2016 —
correcting an earlier misattribution to "Zhang et al."; Zhang is a coauthor,
not first author) and quantitative quiescent consistency
(Jagadeesan & Riely, ICALP 2014) are the right ancestors for "approximately
correct read" — but they relax *ordering* by a bounded amount, not *set
membership under an approximate retrieval function*. Cite as lineage; do not
claim to have invented relaxed correctness.

**Cite and distinguish:** *Coordination-Free Lane Partitioning for Convergent ANN
Search* (arXiv:2511.04221) sounds like a collision but concerns disjoint
candidate partitioning within a single query, not replica convergence.

### 2. Jepsen-family testing of vector databases — **GAP**

`jepsen.io/analyses` lists **no vector database**. Not Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate,
Pinecone, or Vespa. The nearest targets are Kingsbury's two Elasticsearch
analyses (1.1.0, 2014; 1.5.0, 2015), and both check **document presence and
acknowledged-write loss** — precisely the exact-store model this work contrasts
against.

**Elle** (Kingsbury & Alvaro, PVLDB 2020) infers transactional anomalies from
observed traces, and its notion of a read is exact value equality. No consistency
checker found has any notion of an *approximately correct* read.

Caveat on evidence: this is a strong absence, not a proof. It is the kind of
claim that should be stated as "we could not find" rather than "there is none".

**But chaos testing of vector stores does exist.** Milvus runs an in-house Chaos
Mesh suite — pod-kill, pod-failure, memory stress, network partition — and files
bugs from it. Their assertions are availability and entity count, never recall.
That is the interesting detail, and it is a much better sentence than "nobody
tests this": *the vendor's own chaos suite would not catch what we measured.*

### 3. Streaming / fresh ANN benchmarks — **COVERS churn, GAP on failure**

FreshDiskANN (arXiv:2105.09613), SPFresh (SOSP '23), the NeurIPS'23 Big-ANN
streaming track (arXiv:2409.17424), and the 2025–26 successors (LSM-VEC, DGAI,
VIBE) all study recall decay under **insert/delete churn on a single index**.
The Big-ANN streaming track is a runbook of inserts, deletes and searches
executed within an hour on one machine, scored by recall@10.

**None injects node failure. None has a replication dimension. None reports
cross-replica variance.** The distinction holds, but it must be stated precisely:
*these measure recall stability under update churn on a single index* — not
"these don't measure recall stability", which would be false.

### 4. Anti-entropy for approximate contents — **COVERS the data, GAP on the index**

Every production anti-entropy mechanism found operates on **exact object
identity**:

- **Weaviate** async replication (GA in v1.29, Feb 2025) uses a real Merkle/hash
  tree over object digests, configurable via `ASYNC_REPLICATION_HASHTREE_HEIGHT`.
- **Vespa** reconciles replicas by exchanging sets of timestamped documents with
  checksummed metadata.
- **Dynamo** (DeCandia et al., SOSP 2007) and Cassandra repair: Merkle trees over
  exact key-value hashes.

The structural point: **two correct HNSW graphs built over identical data differ
bit-for-bit**, so none of these mechanisms can be pointed at the index. Elastic's
own writeup confirms that every *shard* builds its own independent HNSW graph
per segment; the extension to every *replica* is a standard-architecture
inference (each replica is itself sharded the same way), not something that
specific page states about replicas directly. Hash-based comparison is simply
not available for the thing that degraded.

**Measured directly since this was written (2026-09-06, #43/#46/#48).** Weaviate's
hash-tree mechanism is no longer cited from documentation alone. Its repair is
**timing-determined and independent of divergence size across 50→5,000**; the
completeness transition is a step at 50–500 objects (≤8–167 ms) and a ~6 s ramp
at 5,000; and at a fixed 40 s outage the latency depends on where inside the
outage the write landed. What that does **not** yet establish is the load-bearing
half — that object-level repair leaves the *graph* unrepaired. That is #54, and
until it runs, §4's argument stays structural.

This forces an honest weakening of our healing result, handled in §Framing risks.

### 5. Ground-truth-free ANN quality estimation — **PARTIAL**

The technique class is old and the ANN-specific instances already exist:

- ***ANN Search: Recall What Matters*** (Dimitropoulos et al., arXiv:2606.04522)
  proposes `1/Ratio@k`, "judge-free, hyperparameter-free... computable from the
  same inputs ANN benchmarks already provide." **Correction:** an earlier draft
  called this "ground-truth-free"; it is not. The metric is defined over
  differences between the retrieved and *true* nearest-neighbour distances, so
  it still needs exact ground truth to compute — "judge-free" (no LLM/human
  judge) is not the same property. It is the closest hit for *low-overhead*
  ANN quality estimation, not for the ground-truth-free property this project
  actually needs.
- ***Semantic Recall for Vector Search*** (SIGIR 2026) introduces *Tolerant
  Recall* as a proxy for when relevant objects cannot be identified.
- ***Towards Robustness: A Critique of Current Vector Database Assessments***
  (arXiv:2507.00379) proposes Robustness-δ@K and argues average recall hides
  variability — but **across queries**, not across replicas.
- Ensemble / jackknife disagreement as a reference-free quality signal is
  standard practice across many fields and decades.

So `leave_one_out_agreement` is not a new estimator, and claiming it as one
invites an easy rejection. What appears unclaimed is the **attribution
argument**: these are replicas of the same shard, which are *supposed to be
identical*, so disagreement between them is damage rather than model diversity.
The 1e-4 independently-built-replica control is what makes that attribution
sound. Claim the argument and the control, not the technique.

**Update 2026-09-06 (#52), and it narrows the claim considerably.** Scoring the
detector on 51 already-committed Qdrant runs found it replicates for
end-to-end quality (0.908 against a 0.635 no-chaos control, p = 0.0023) and is
**at chance for graph quality** — 0.348 against a chance line of 0.333, versus a
0.670 baseline, separating at p = 0.0001 *in the wrong direction*.

So the detector does not find the replica that this project's own headline
Qdrant finding is about. Any claim about `loo_agreement` must name the axis. The
likely reason is worth stating because it is the thesis turned on the tool: the
statistic compares *returned results*, so a replica missing objects is easy to
flag, while a replica holding all the data with a slightly worse graph returns
nearly the same answers. **The detector is subject to the silence the project
exists to study.** Whether a different ground-truth-free statistic can see graph
damage is now the most consequential open question here.

### 6. Production evidence — **moderate**

Ranked by how directly each supports "approximation converts data loss into
silence". **Correction:** an earlier version of this section led with
ClickHouse #104674 as the strongest evidence and called its resolution "the
argument." A verification pass reading the full comment thread found the
reporter **retracted their own report** — on retest, the ANN/brute-force
disagreement reproduced on a clean server with no crash involved; it was a
bf16-quantization precision artifact, not a durability bug, and there was no
maintainer dismissal to cite. It is removed below. This is exactly the failure
mode this section warns about elsewhere (§8, framing risks) — a citation that
sounds too convenient checked out to be wrong, which is why every citation here
has now been read past its headline.

1. **Milvus #37703** — after chaos and *nominal* recovery, search failed with
   `segment lacks`, 69% success rate (`Op.search succ rate 0.6933...` in the
   issue's own log). **This one errored loudly**, and is a genuine
   counterexample to universal silence — cite it honestly as that, not as an
   instance of the silent-failure thesis.
2. **Qdrant #4626** — confirmed: upserts committed by majority during a node
   restart never sync to the node once it comes back.
3. **Qdrant #4627** — confirmed: deletes during a restart leave the restarted
   node's points with empty, unsynced payloads.
4. **Milvus #30254** — confirmed: `NoSuchKey` errors on segment files, traced to
   the garbage collector deleting segments still in use.
5. **Pinecone's observability blog** states the thesis in prose, close to but
   not exactly the wording an earlier draft quoted verbatim — the actual text is
   "a stale, undersized, or under-resourced index doesn't go down. It returns
   the wrong results. The problem is that without continuous visibility into
   index health... there's no signal [something is wrong]." Paraphrase, don't
   quote, if this is used. A vendor stating the thesis in prose is good
   motivation and a reminder that the *observation* is not novel — only the
   measurement is.

**What was not found:** any public postmortem or engineering writeup that
*quantified* a recall divergence between replicas of the same shard, still. The
motivation gap is now sharper without ClickHouse #104674 to lean on — Milvus
#37703 and the Qdrant pair are real but none of them isolate a recall number
the way this project's `index_recall`/`completeness` decomposition does. A
reviewer may reasonably ask who was harmed, and the honest answer is "no public
report of exactly this, only adjacent bugs" — which is closer to the actual
strength of the motivation than the earlier draft implied.

### 7. Stratified vs aggregate recall, and replica divergence — **PARTIAL, and this is the bound on novelty item 1**

Added 2026-09-06 (#55). The scooping re-run found that **the general principle
behind this project's strongest result is already stated**, and that not saying
so would be the most likely way to get the paper rejected.

**The principle is known.** That a mean recall number hides per-stratum failure
is established in at least three places:

- **Across queries / embedding regions.** arXiv:2507.00379 (Robustness-δ@K) and
  the newer arXiv:2608.25185 both show that "optimizing for mean recall masks
  significant differences in recall across queries even when target recall is
  met." The latter partitions the embedding space by k-means and compares
  recall between regions — single index, no replication, no fault injection.
- **Across tenants / namespaces.** Practitioner writing states the operational
  version bluntly: when tenants share an HNSW graph one tenant can sit 5–10
  recall points lower, an aggregate number averages it away, and you should
  **gate on the worst stratum, not the mean.** That is structurally the same
  recommendation this project arrives at, one level of abstraction away.

**Replica divergence itself is also known, qualitatively.** A production
write-up describes replicas "that are supposedly the same" slowly diverging so
that "identical queries may return different neighbors depending on where they
land," and lists **"recall variance across nodes"** as a metric to monitor. It
attributes the cause to asynchronous writes, partial batches, background
rebuilds and out-of-order ingestion — **not** to node failure — and it
quantifies nothing, where the same article gives hard numbers for other failure
modes.

**So what is actually left.** Not "averaging hides degradation," and not "replicas
can diverge." What no source found does:

1. **Strata that are supposed to be identical.** Tenants and embedding regions
   differ *legitimately* — a worst-namespace gate is managing expected
   heterogeneity. Replicas of one shard are supposed to hold the same data and
   answer the same way, so divergence between them is **damage**, and the 1e-4
   independently-built-replica control is what licenses that attribution. This
   is the same argument §5 already makes for `loo_agreement`, and it is the
   load-bearing one.
2. **Attribution to injected failure**, rather than to ingestion asynchrony.
3. **A number.** 0.978 vs 0.990, p = 0.0079 replica-level against p = 0.31 on
   the cluster mean of the same runs. The practitioner sources name the metric
   and do not report it.

**Cite and distinguish, do not claim:** the stratified-recall principle, and the
observation that replicas drift. Claim the identity argument, the failure
attribution, and the measurement.

---

## Novelty verdict

**Re-ranked 2026-09-06 (#55).** The original ranking is kept below, struck,
because the reason it changed is worth more than the ranking itself.

~~1. Recall measured per replica within a shard, under node-kill chaos.
2. The three-way decomposition.
3. `miss@stop == miss@end` after full recovery. **The sharpest claim, because it
   is falsifiable, surprising, and unmeasured.**~~

Item 3 cannot be the sharpest claim, and this document said so elsewhere all
along. Framing risk #5 states that the 0% healing result is scoped to nano-db
**because nano-db has no anti-entropy by design** — `coordinator_main.cpp`
documents it. "Data never returns in a system built with no repair mechanism" is
close to definitional, not surprising. And Qdrant, which does have replica
recovery, **heals at a 180 s horizon** (#35 / PR #37). The subtitle question
"does it ever come back?" currently answers *yes on the production system, no on
the one that has no way to*. Two sections of this file were making opposite
claims about the same result.

The current ranking, strongest first:

1. **The measurement unit is the finding: replica-level separation with a
   cluster-level null on the same runs.** On Qdrant, worst-replica
   `index_recall` under chaos is 0.978 vs 0.990 at baseline, every seed
   separated, exact p = 0.0079 — while the **mean over the same six replicas
   does not separate, p = 0.31**. Both are correct. A monitor that averages is
   structurally blind to this. See §7 for what bounds that claim, because the
   general principle is *not* new.
2. **The three-way decomposition** — `index_recall` (graph quality, data held
   constant) vs `completeness` (data content, no search) vs `e2e_recall` (client
   experience). Vendor blogs gesture at "index quality vs retrieval quality";
   nobody found isolates completeness as a replication-damage diagnostic.
3. **Cross-system reproduction under a *fixed instrument*.** The Qdrant result
   only became measurable after an indexing gate (#28) showed the first attempt
   had measured an un-indexed corpus. That the first measurement was wrong, was
   caught, and was withdrawn in both directions is part of the contribution, not
   an embarrassment to hide.
4. ~~`miss@stop == miss@end`~~ — demoted. Still true on nano-db, still worth
   reporting, but definitional given that system's design and contradicted on
   the system that has repair.

The framing "approximation converts data loss into silence, so no Jepsen-family
checker can flag it" is defensible: no checker found models an approximately
correct read, and no Jepsen analysis has targeted a vector store.

**Already well-trodden — cite, do not claim:** the ANN oracle problem
(arXiv:2502.20812 states it in the abstract); average recall hiding variance
across queries (arXiv:2507.00379, arXiv:2608.25185) and across tenants
(practitioner writing, §7); low-overhead ANN quality estimation
(arXiv:2606.04522, SIGIR'26); jackknife/ensemble disagreement; recall decay
under churn (FreshDiskANN, SPFresh, Big-ANN'23); Merkle-tree anti-entropy
(Dynamo); **that replicas of the same shard can silently diverge** (§7 — a
practitioner post says it plainly, and names "recall variance across nodes" as a
metric to watch); and the general observation that a degraded index returns
worse answers instead of paging you — Pinecone says this in a marketing post.

## Framing risks — what NOT to claim

This is the load-bearing section. The README and any write-up get checked
against it.

1. **Do not claim to be first to notice ANN has no test oracle.**
   arXiv:2502.20812 says it in the abstract. Claim instead: first to show the
   oracle problem *has teeth under replication and failure*, with a measurement.

2. **Do not claim "nobody chaos-tests vector databases."** Milvus ships a Chaos
   Mesh suite and files bugs from it. Claim: *their assertions are liveness and
   entity counts, never recall.*

3. **Do not claim "recall degradation in vector DBs is unknown."** It is blogged
   extensively and studied under churn and corpus growth. Claim: degradation
   *attributable to replica-level failure damage, persisting after recovery*, is
   unmeasured.

4. **Do not claim `leave_one_out_agreement` as a new detector.** Jackknife
   ensemble disagreement is standard, and `1/Ratio@k` already gives a
   low-overhead ANN quality signal (not actually ground-truth-free — it still
   needs true-neighbour distances; see the must-cite table entry). Claim the
   replica-identity attribution argument plus the 1e-4 nondeterminism control.

5. **Do not claim "no vector database repairs missing data."** Weaviate 1.29
   ships real hash-tree anti-entropy; Vespa reconciles by timestamped-document
   checksum. **The 0% healing result is scoped to nano-db**, which has no
   anti-entropy by design — `cluster/coordinator_main.cpp` already documents that
   element-count comparison is "a scalar proxy, not a true diff" and that real
   reconciliation is a separate effort. So the claim is not *"systems fail to
   repair"* but ***"there is no signal that would tell you to repair"***, and the
   reason the exact-store anti-entropy that does exist cannot be pointed at the
   index is §4: two correct HNSW graphs over identical data differ bit-for-bit.
   Stated as a universal law, one reviewer with Weaviate experience sinks this.

6. **Do not claim all such failures are silent.** Milvus #37703 errored loudly.
   The claim is *"approximation permits silence, and the silent variants are the
   ones that go unfixed"* — this project's own `miss@stop == miss@end` result is
   the load-bearing exhibit here now, not a borrowed production issue. No public
   report found *quantifies* a silent recall divergence the way this project's
   own measurement does; say that plainly rather than reaching for a citation
   that doesn't hold up (see §6 above on ClickHouse #104674).

7. **Watch the title collision** with arXiv:2511.04221 ("Convergent ANN Search").
   Distinguish explicitly.

9. **Do not claim to be first to notice that replicas diverge, or that averaging
   hides it.** Added 2026-09-06 after the scooping re-run (§7, §9). A
   practitioner write-up states replica divergence plainly and names "recall
   variance across nodes" as a metric; the stratified-vs-aggregate principle is
   published across queries (arXiv:2507.00379, arXiv:2608.25185) and stated
   operationally across tenants. Claim instead: **strata that are supposed to be
   identical**, so divergence is damage rather than expected heterogeneity;
   **attribution to injected failure** rather than ingestion asynchrony; and **a
   number** where the practitioner sources give none. This is the risk most
   likely to sink the paper if left unaddressed, because the reviewer who knows
   the operational literature will recognise the principle immediately.

10. **Do not claim `loo_agreement` detects degraded replicas, unqualified.**
    #52 measured it at chance on graph quality (0.348 vs a 0.333 chance line)
    while replicating for end-to-end quality (0.908 vs 0.635). Every claim about
    the detector must name the axis.

8. **n=5 will get probed.** Lead with effect sizes and per-run data, not the
   p-value — 0.0079 is the exact floor for 5v5, so it carries less information
   than it looks like it does. The direct mitigation is `--dist sift`: an
   independent replication on real data is worth more than another synthetic seed.

## 9. Scooping check — what was actually searched, and when

Recorded so the next person knows what was covered rather than trusting that
"a search was done." The August 2026 pass did not record its queries; this one
does.

**2026-09-06**, four queries, US-region web search:

1. `detecting silent degradation replicated approximate nearest neighbor index recall divergence vector database`
2. `ground-truth-free recall estimation peer agreement replicas consistency checking vector search production monitoring`
3. `metamorphic testing differential testing approximate nearest neighbor index correctness oracle problem`
4. `per-replica search quality monitoring vector database replica-level recall divergence averaging hides degradation`
5. `Qdrant Weaviate replica node failure chaos recall divergence per-replica measurement 2026`

**Found and now cited:** arXiv:2608.25185 (query-level recall variance, single
index — entry 17) and a practitioner write-up stating replica divergence
qualitatively and naming "recall variance across nodes" as a metric (entry 18).
Both narrow what may be claimed; see §7 and framing risk 9.

**Not found:** any work measuring recall *per replica of the same shard* under
injected failure, or quantifying a replica-level divergence. Query 5 returned
only vendor comparisons and documentation. Query 3 confirmed the oracle-problem
framing this project sits in is well-established software-engineering
vocabulary — worth adopting explicitly in a write-up, since it gives the
contribution a name reviewers already have.

**Standing caveat, unchanged:** this is "we could not find," not "there is
none." Two of the three prior-art surprises in this document's history —
ClickHouse #104674's retraction, and the two entries above — were found by
looking again at something already believed settled.

Pragmatic path: arXiv preprint plus an engineering writeup
(`research/postmortems/recall-bugs.md` is already most of one). The area is moving
fast enough — several 2026 arXiv entries, two of them found in this refresh —
that preprint priority matters more than usual.

**The blocker is not a deadline.** `research/replica_recall/` has no committed
raw data (#53), so the study every claim here is built on is currently
reported-but-not-checkable. That is the first thing an external reader would
find, and no venue is worth submitting to before it is closed.
