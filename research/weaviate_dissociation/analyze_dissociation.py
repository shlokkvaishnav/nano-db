"""
Does `completeness` heal on Weaviate while `index_recall` does not? (issue #54)

Reads `results/dissociation.json` and nothing else, and recomputes every figure
the writeup leads with. This exists because #59's review found that study's
headline result was reachable only by reading prose: its committed analyser
printed the aggregate the PR overturned. An analyser that does not reproduce the
conclusion is not a reproducibility artifact.

The pre-registered primary metric, per seed:

    completeness returns to 1.0 within the window
      AND post-chaos index_recall is outside its own pre-chaos range

Both halves are reported per seed, with the censoring status, because a
right-censored completeness series answers "did it heal within 60 s" with
"unknown", not with "no".
