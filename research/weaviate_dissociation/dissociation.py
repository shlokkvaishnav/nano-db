Does `completeness` heal on Weaviate while `index_recall` does not? (issue #54)

The experiment the four Weaviate method studies (#41, #43, #46, #48) were built
to make runnable, and the only one that tests this project's field-level claim:
object-level anti-entropy repairs the DATA and cannot repair the GRAPH, because
two correct HNSW graphs over identical data differ bit-for-bit.

THE INSTRUMENT IS ASYMMETRIC AND THAT IS PERMANENT. `_search` is unavailable on
the cluster-internal port (#43, 415 across 12 content types), so:

    completeness   sampled every 1 s, peers up, non-perturbing      (#43/#46)
    index_recall   two snapshots, via isolation probing, ~10 min
                   of node health each                              (#41)

So this compares a time series against a pair of endpoints. Any writeup must
carry that in the claim rather than implying both axes were watched.

GROUND TRUTH NEEDS NO SERVER SUPPORT. The corpus comes from a seeded RNG, so
the exact top-k over *the subset a replica actually holds* -- which
objects_present_ids reports -- is computable locally with numpy. index_recall is
the replica's ANN answer against exact search over its own data, holding data
constant. Same definition as nano-db and Qdrant.
