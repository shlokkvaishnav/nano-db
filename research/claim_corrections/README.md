# claim_corrections

Corrections to claims this project had already published, each recording *why*
the wording was wrong rather than only what it now says.

These are not experiments. They collect no data and test no hypothesis, which is
why they live here rather than as `research/<experiment>/` directories — that
namespace means "an experiment lives here," and two documentation corrections
filed alongside real sweeps made the index harder to read, not richer.

| file | what was corrected |
|---|---|
| [`layer3-query-pinning.md`](layer3-query-pinning.md) | The README listed "does `loo_agreement` survive non-pinned queries?" as open after PR #7 had answered it. Narrowed to the axis still genuinely open — a different query *distribution*, not merely a non-pinned one. |
| [`qdrant-graph-quality-withdrawal.md`](qdrant-graph-quality-withdrawal.md) | The cross-system spec listed "Qdrant diverges in data completeness but not graph quality" under *establishes*. PR #11 showed that `index_recall` comparison ran over a corpus that was un-indexed for 60–84% of the measurement window, so it measured exact scans rather than a graph. Withdrawn in **both** directions. |
| [`qdrant-graph-axis-established.md`](qdrant-graph-axis-established.md) | The reverse direction of the row above, two days later: on a corpus gated HNSW-indexed (PR #29) and at the replica level, Qdrant's `index_recall` *does* diverge under chaos (PR #31, p = 0.0079) — while the cluster-wide mean does not (p = 0.31). README ESTABLISHED/HYPOTHESIS/DO-NOT-CLAIM and open question #1 rewritten with the unit in the claim; `DECISION_LOG` records why the unit is the replica. Not a correction of an error this time, but the same discipline: the sentence that would read best ("Qdrant's graph diverges under chaos") is the one that must not be written without its qualifier. |
| [`qdrant-healing-transient.md`](qdrant-healing-transient.md) | The README carried "the per-replica `index_recall` loss on Qdrant does not fully heal" as HYPOTHESIS, from a 50s quiesce window with 4-5 samples. At 180s it heals (PR #37), and the data axis recovers 100% where the same 50s window had shown 0-100%. Retired as a horizon effect — the withdrawn claim is struck, not deleted, and the replacement carries its own qualifiers (4 of 5 seeds, one unmeasured, 180s, one host, a 0.0002 margin on the closest seed). |
| [`weaviate-repair-two-path-withdrawal.md`](weaviate-repair-two-path-withdrawal.md) | Two Weaviate repair claims withdrawn together (2026-09-06, PR #51). PR #45's single ~0.3 s observation had become the bound *"any healing measurement must beat 0.3s"*, making sub-second sampling "the only remaining prerequisite" — repair is actually timing-determined and spans milliseconds to ~52 s, so 1–5 s cadence suffices and that work was cancelled. And PR #49's *"nothing falls between 0.2 s and 36 s → two discrete paths"* fell to 12 of 18 runs inside that interval once conditions were fixed rather than randomized. Both are mechanism claims inferred from the shape of a measurement taken for another purpose. |

Each file keeps its review addenda, and those are the reason this directory is
worth preserving at all. The corrections themselves are short; what is not
recorded anywhere else is the pattern the review rounds exposed — **every
overstatement found ran in the same direction, toward a tidier and more
confident claim than the evidence supported, including one that appeared inside
a correction of an over-claim, in the clause asserting that something had been
checked rather than assumed.**

That is a standing bias in how results get written up, not a set of one-off
slips, and in every case the only thing that caught it was re-reading the raw
per-seed data instead of the prose describing it. It has held through five
entries. The 2026-09-04 one (PR #37) was a summary sentence calling a
0.003 dip with n = 3 "0.001 with n = 1-2" — smaller, tidier, and wrong, in a
writeup whose own table said otherwise.

**The fifth entry extends the pattern rather than repeating it.** Its two
corrections are not overstated *results* but overstated *mechanisms*: one
observation became a bound, and an empty interval in a pooled sample became two
code paths. The measurements were fine; the stories told about them were not.
It also records the first case where **pre-registration itself carried the
error** — a binary metric whose threshold was fixed because a structure was
believed to exist, so the statistic went void when the structure did. Registering
an estimand rather than a dichotomization is the fix.
