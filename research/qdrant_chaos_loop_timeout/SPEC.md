# Spec: method/chaos-loop-timeout

**Branch:** `method/chaos-loop-timeout`
**Issue:** #38 (body copied verbatim below, per `AGENT_PIPELINE.md`)
**Date opened:** 2026-09-04
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Type

method (a new methodological component — metric, detector, protocol)

### Research question

Not a research question — a harness defect in the shape of #26. `qdrant_run_experiment.py`'s randomized chaos loop can leave a run with **no kill events in a chaos window that ran far longer than requested**, and nothing in the run's output says so except an empty `events.json` and a `chaos_stop_rel` that does not match `--chaos-duration`.

### Hypothesis

Observed once (PR for #35, seed 20261100 quiesce): `--chaos-duration 50`, `chaos_start_rel` 156s, `chaos_stop_rel` 283s — a **127s** window — with `events.json == []`. The other four quiesce runs in the same sweep had 53–58s windows and 3–4 kills. `chaos_stop_rel` is recorded after `ct.join(timeout=20.0)`, so a window past ~70s means the chaos thread did not return on time; a `docker kill` or `docker start` call that blocked is consistent with that and the likeliest cause, but it was not observed — the loop records events only after a kill *completes*, so a blocked call leaves no trace.

### Null / alternative hypothesis

N/A. The defect is that the record is silent; the fix is to make it loud.

### Motivation

A run like this looks like a healthy quiesce run to every downstream tool (`aggregate.py` skipped it silently because it had nothing to heal; `analyze_healing.py` would have scored it "healed" until a zero-kill rule was added mid-sweep). It cost one of five pre-registered seeds in #35 and would have cost the conclusion if the rule had not been added before the numbers were used. Every future chaos run on this harness is exposed.

### Experimental design

Harness-only, on `research/cross_system_replication/qdrant_run_experiment.py` and `qdrant_docker_harness.py`:

1. Wrap each `docker kill` / `docker start` in the randomized loop with a timeout (e.g. 30s); on timeout, append an event with `alive_after_restart: null`, `timed_out: true`, and the elapsed time, and continue or abort per a flag.
2. Record `chaos_requested_s` and `chaos_realized_s` in `run_meta.json`; if realized exceeds requested by more than the join timeout, set `chaos_window_overrun: true`.
3. `run_meta.json` gains `kill_count`; a chaos or quiesce run with `kill_count == 0` prints a FATAL-style warning at the end and sets `chaos_no_kills: true`, so a sweep driver can refuse it the way `qdrant_sweep.py` refuses a missing `samples.csv`.
4. Validation: one no-cluster test with a fake container whose `kill()` blocks, following `qdrant_kill_scheduler/test_kill_schedule.py`'s pattern; one live run at #35's parameters confirming normal runs are unchanged.

### Metrics

N/A — pass/fail on the test, plus a diff of `run_meta.json` before/after on a normal run showing only the new fields.

### Baselines / controls

Seed 20261100's quiesce run in `research/qdrant_index_recall_healing/results/` is the case to reproduce against (a blocked call cannot be reproduced on demand; the fake-container test stands in).

### Expected outcomes

The harness cannot again produce a chaos run with zero kills that reads as normal.

### Interpretation plan

N/A.

### Confounds considered

A timeout that is too short would turn slow-but-successful restarts (Qdrant's `docker start` costs ~3.3s, #19) into false timeouts; 30s is an order of magnitude above that.

### Before submitting

- [x] I checked README.md's "Open research questions" and research/DECISION_LOG.md and this isn't a duplicate or already-ruled-out question.
- [x] This is one answerable question, not a broad restatement of the whole research thesis.

## Instrument characterization

*Section added 2026-09-06. `SPEC_TEMPLATE.md:43` made this required on 2026-09-03; these five SPECs were opened after that date without it. The text below records what the study actually established about its apparatus — it is not back-filled content invented after the fact.*

This study **is** an instrument characterization in the strictest sense: the apparatus was the subject. The property surfaced is that both chaos loops run in daemon threads with no exception handling, so a `TimeoutExpired` ended a loop with no event, no log line and a normal exit — a run that reported success while injecting no chaos. Known remaining gap, named rather than fixed: the sampler and validator threads have the same shape.

## Results

**Root cause, more specific than this issue guessed.** The issue said "a `docker kill`/`start` call that blocked is consistent with [the 127s window]." It is narrower than that: `ManagedContainer._docker` already runs `subprocess.run(..., timeout=30)`, so a hung daemon does **not** block forever — it raises `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`. Both chaos loops run in **daemon threads** with no exception handling, so that raise ends the loop immediately and silently: no event, no log line, no non-zero exit. The run then completes normally. `chaos_stop_rel` is recorded when the phase timer ends and the container-revival loop finishes, which is why the window read 127s while `events.json` was empty. The proposed fix (add a timeout) was already half-present; what was missing was catching what the timeout raises.

**Changes.**

1. `chaos_loop` and `chaos_loop_scheduled` wrap each kill/restart in `try/except Exception`, append an event with `failed: true`, `error`, `timed_out` (true iff `TimeoutExpired`), `alive_after_restart: null`, print a `[chaos] FAILED …` line, and **continue to the next kill**. The scheduled loop's failed events keep their full provenance (`condition`, `seq`, `requested_at_s`, `realized_at_s`, `requested_gap_s`, `realized_gap_s`).
2. `run_meta.json` gains `kill_count` (completed kills), `kill_failures`, `chaos_no_kills`, `chaos_requested_s`, `chaos_realized_s`. Successful events gain `failed: false`, so old and new records are distinguishable.
3. The runner prints a WARNING to stderr when chaos was requested and no kill completed.
4. `qdrant_sweep.py` refuses such a run — `FAILED (chaos requested but no kill completed; N failed attempt(s), window Xs vs requested Ys -- issue #38)` — the same way it refuses a missing `samples.csv`. **`json` was not imported in that file**, so the guard as first written would have raised `NameError` on the exact path it guards; caught by importing it and asserting the symbol resolves.

**Validation.**

- `test_chaos_failures.py`, no Docker: **13/13**. Covers both loops against fake containers that raise `TimeoutExpired` and a plain `RuntimeError`; asserts the failed event's fields, that `timed_out` distinguishes the two, that **the loop survives and keeps killing** (the defect itself), that a later success is `failed: false`, that the scheduled loop's failed step keeps its provenance, and that neither thread is left running.
- `../qdrant_kill_scheduler/test_kill_schedule.py`: **27/27** unchanged — the modified loops still satisfy the scheduler's own checks.
- **Live run** (`--chaos-duration 40 --pre-chaos-s 15 --duration 90`, 60k vectors, seed 20261200): `kill_count: 3`, `kill_failures: 0`, `chaos_no_kills: false`, `chaos_requested_s: 40`, `chaos_realized_s: 40.929`, three events all `failed: false` with `alive_after_restart: true`. A healthy run is unchanged apart from the new fields.

**What this does not do.** It does not make a hung Docker daemon less likely, and it does not retro-diagnose seed 20261100 — that run predates the fix, so its `events.json` is empty either way and it stays excluded in `../qdrant_index_recall_healing/`. It does not add a timeout to the *sampler* or *validator* threads, which have the same daemon-thread shape and are the obvious next place to look; that is deliberately out of scope here rather than folded in.

## Interpretation

The defect is not that a Docker call can hang — that was already handled, with a
30 s timeout. The defect is that the handling **raised into a daemon thread
nobody was watching**, which converted a recoverable error into a run that
looked complete and was empty. The instrument reported success while measuring
nothing.

That is worth naming precisely, because it is the same shape as the phenomenon
this project studies. The research claim is that an approximate index which
loses data still returns plausible answers, so no checker fires; here a chaos
harness that stopped injecting chaos still produced a well-formed `samples.csv`,
so no reviewer fired. In both cases the failure is invisible **at the level
anyone is looking at**.

The generalisable lesson is the one now applied across this repo: an instrument
must be able to say *"I did not measure anything"*, and something downstream
must refuse that record. Hence the three levels — a `failed` event, a
`chaos_no_kills` flag in `run_meta`, and a sweep that rejects the run outright.
A fix at only the first level would have left the same silence one layer up.

The scope limit is deliberate. The sampler and validator threads share the same
daemon-thread shape and are unfixed; they are named here rather than repaired,
so the next person meets a known gap instead of an unknown one.

## Decision

**MERGE.** The defect was a silent failure in the instrument that already cost one pre-registered seed; the fix makes it loud at three levels (event, `run_meta`, sweep refusal), is covered by tests that fail without it, and leaves healthy runs byte-identical apart from the new fields. Additive; no metric, dataset, or protocol changed.
