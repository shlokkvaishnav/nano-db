"""Mechanical checks on the research record. Fails CI on drift a script can see.

`check_index.py` proved the shape works: it checks one thing that can be
mechanised, refuses to judge prose, and turned "the index drifted again" into a
red X. This extends the same philosophy to five more defect classes, every one
of which was found by a HUMAN audit in one session and none of which the
pipeline caught:

  1. a SPEC whose Status says DRAFT while it carries Results and a Decision
  2. a SPEC missing a section SPEC_TEMPLATE.md marks required
  3. a study directory with no README
  4. a results/ directory with no script beside it that could have produced it
  5. a retired claim still stated unqualified somewhere  <- the important one
  6. DECISION_LOG.md not mentioning a completed study    <- advisory only

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, same as check_index.py: judge whether a
description is accurate. A row reading "Not started" for finished work passes.
Judging prose needs judgement and cannot be mechanised; the honest claim is
narrow.

Two tiers, on purpose. FAIL is for defects with no legitimate instance -- a
DRAFT header over a Decision is always wrong. WARN is for signals with real
exceptions, reported without failing the build, because a checker that cries
wolf gets switched off and then catches nothing at all.

Check 5 is the one worth having. When #48 withdrew the "~0.3 s bound", its
consequence note named two files and four other sites survived for a day. A
retirement recorded as a searchable string in `retired_claims.txt` cannot be
under-enumerated that way.

Usage:
    python research/check_research.py            # exit 1 on any FAIL
    python research/check_research.py --list     # report everything, exit 0
