"""
Autopsy of an HNSW index file. Answers *why* a damaged replica searches worse.

The replica-recall experiment establishes that node-kill chaos drops
index_recall with the data held constant -- a replica missing nothing still
searches worse, so the graph is damaged independently of its contents. That is
the finding. This is the follow-up question: what, structurally, is the damage?

The index is memory-mapped to disk as a dense array of fixed-size nodes, so a
damaged replica can be dissected offline with no cluster running:

    HEADER_SIZE (64) + id * sizeof(Node) (1056)

The original hypothesis -- insertion writes the node first and links it
afterwards, so a SIGKILL in between leaves a node that is present but that
nothing points at -- turned out wrong. Structural checks (in-degree,
out-degree, dangling edges) come back clean on 20 of 30 chaos replicas and on
every replica in a dedicated 16-writer, zero-chaos concurrency stress test.
What actually happened, once, was far more specific: one replica (never
itself killed) lost reachability to 58.7% of its own graph while every
structural check on it looked completely healthy -- see
../postmortems/catastrophic-disconnection.md for the full investigation,
including two more specific hypotheses that were tested and also ruled out.
The cause is still open.

The load-bearing metric is therefore in-degree AND explicit reachability, not
just out-degree. A node with no in-edges and which is not the entry point
cannot be reached by any traversal from any starting point -- that is a
proof, not an estimate, and needs no assumption about how search descends the
layers. But the observed damage shows in-degree alone is not enough either:
the unreachable nodes in the one damaged replica found so far all had real
in-edges from each other, just none from the entry point's component.

    Structural forensics can come back clean while search still degrades: the

    damage mode a replica suffers when it misses writes -- nodes inserted while
    the replica was behind get linked into a sparser graph, and nothing ever
    revisits those links once the missing vectors arrive.

    the vectors this replica actually holds*, and reports what fraction of them
    appear in the node's stored layer-0 adjacency list. Ground truth is drawn

    isolates graph quality from data completeness.

    The absolute value is not meant to reach 1.0 and a healthy index will not
