# Replica recall divergence under failure

**Layer 1 experiment.** Does the recall of an approximate index diverge across
replicas under failure — and can you detect it without ground truth?

## The question

Every streaming-ANN result (FreshDiskANN, the NeurIPS'23 Big-ANN streaming
track, Mycelium, LSM-VEC) studies **one index on one machine**. Every
distributed-correctness tool (Jepsen/Knossos/Elle) assumes operations have
**exact expected values**. Nobody works the intersection, and the intersection
has a nasty property:

> An approximate index has no observable correctness criterion under replication.

A replica returns *k* neighbours. They look fine. You cannot distinguish:

| cause | what the client sees |
|---|---|
| healthy replica, ordinary ANN nondeterminism | k plausible results |
| replica silently missing 30% of its vectors | k plausible results |
| replica whose graph degraded from churn | k plausible results |
| replica stale w.r.t. recent writes | k plausible results |

No crash, no error, no consistency violation any existing checker can name.
Practitioners report this as real — "replica recall variance … quiet to
catastrophic instantly" — with no published study.

## What is measured

Four numbers per replica per sample. The first three need ground truth; the
fourth does not, and that asymmetry is the point.

| metric | ground truth used | isolates |
|---|---|---|
| `index_recall` | exact top-k over **the replica's own live set** | graph / ANN quality |
| `completeness` | intended set (no search involved) | data content |
| `e2e_recall` | exact top-k over **the intended set** | what a client experiences |
| `shard_agreement` | **none** — pairwise overlap across a shard | shard-level health |
| `loo_agreement` | **none** — one replica's overlap with its peers | *which replica to distrust* |

Holding data content constant (`index_recall`) versus holding search constant
(`completeness`) is what separates "the graph rotted" from "the data is
missing". A single recall number cannot do this, which is why nobody has
reported the distinction.

The last two are the only ones computable on a live system, and `loo_agreement`
is the one that matters. Correlating shard-level agreement against shard-level
recall turns out to be close to tautological: when every replica misses the
*same* hard queries, cross-replica overlap collapses onto recall whether or not
anything is broken — it reads ~1.0 on a healthy cluster too, so it detects
nothing.

The operational question is not "is recall low" but **"which replica should I
distrust?"** So each replica is scored by how well it agrees with its peers,
and the experiment asks whether the lowest-scoring replica is in fact the
lowest-recall one, measured against a chance baseline of 1/n. That is a real
detection test. If it beats chance, it is a production signal for a currently
silent failure (Layer 3). If it does not, that is also a result — it means
detection requires sentinel queries with known answers, not peer comparison.

## Design decisions worth knowing

**Probes bypass the coordinator.** Every call goes directly to a replica's
gRPC port via `ShardService.Search` / `ListLocalIds`. Going through the
coordinator would merge replicas via scatter-gather and hide the exact
divergence under study.

**The intended set is derived empirically, not from routing.** A replica of
shard 0 legitimately does not hold shard 1's vectors, so "intended" must be
per-shard. Rather than reimplement the consistent-hash ring in Python (which
would silently drift from the C++), it is defined as:

```
intended(s) = (union of live ids across replicas of s) ∩ (confirmed, settled writes)
```

This measures divergence *within* a replica group. The case it deliberately
does not catch — a confirmed id that **every** replica of a shard lost — is
total data loss, a different failure, already covered by `chaos_harness.py`'s
invariant #1 via the coordinator.

**A settling window is applied.** A write confirmed 200 ms ago may legitimately
not have reached every replica. Counting it would score normal replication lag
as data loss. Only writes confirmed more than `--settle-s` ago (default 2 s)
are held against a replica.

**The query set is pinned and seeded.** Identical at every sample and across
runs, so recall differences are attributable to the cluster, not the queries.
This is a deliberate control, and it was checked rather than assumed: at the
scale tested, pinning does not appear to be load-bearing for `loo_agreement`'s
detection accuracy (three 5-seed conditions — pinned, non-pinned/100 queries,
non-pinned/15 — mean hit rates 0.87 / 0.86 / 0.81 against a 1/3 chance line,
no pairwise difference detectable at n=5). Q4's result below therefore does not
appear to hinge on the pinned workload, though n=5 is a weak instrument for
saying so. `run_experiment.py`'s
`--loo-query-mode nonpinned` runs the alternative; see
[`../loo_agreement_nonpinned_queries/SPEC.md`](../loo_agreement_nonpinned_queries/SPEC.md).

**Unreachable is recorded, not raised.** The chaos loop is killing these
processes. An unreachable replica is a data point — and notably the *honest*
failure mode, the one you can actually see.

**Partial samples are discarded.** If any query in a sweep fails, the replica
is marked unreachable for that sample rather than scored on a partial result,
which would mix pre- and post-failure state inside one measurement.

## Running it

Requires Linux with the cluster binaries built (the harness launches processes
directly; no Docker).

```bash
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools numpy
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNANODB_BUILD_CLUSTER=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# baseline first: divergence with NO faults. Establishes the noise floor.
python research/replica_recall/run_experiment.py --duration 180 --no-chaos
mv research/replica_recall/results research/replica_recall/results_baseline

# then with fault injection
python research/replica_recall/run_experiment.py --duration 300

python research/replica_recall/analyze.py
python research/replica_recall/analyze.py --results-dir research/replica_recall/results_baseline
```

**Run the baseline first.** Some cross-replica disagreement is expected even
in a healthy cluster: HNSW insertion order differs per replica, so the graphs
are genuinely different. Without the no-chaos noise floor you cannot claim any
observed divergence was caused by failure.

### Choosing a corpus (`--dist`)

This matters more than any other flag. It decides whether the recall numbers
mean anything at all, and it is recorded in `run_meta.json` and printed by
`analyze.py` so a result can never be quoted against the wrong corpus.

| `--dist` | what it is | when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `uniform` | random 128-d vectors in [-1, 1] | **the trap.** See below |
| `lowdim` | sampled in a 12-d subspace, projected to 128-d | fast, no download, roughly the regime real embeddings occupy |
| `sift` | the real SIFT1M dataset | **the one to report.** No dependence on a generator written for this project |

`uniform` suffers distance concentration: in 128 uniform dimensions the nearest
and farthest neighbours of a query are almost equidistant, so the true top-k is
close to arbitrary and recall falls with N for reasons that have nothing to do
with the index. Measured here, the noise it introduces was about **5× the
effect being studied** — `index_recall` showed no separation between baseline
and chaos on `uniform` (p = 0.31) while separating cleanly on realistic vectors
(p = 0.0079). A benchmark built on uniform random vectors would have concluded
there was nothing to find.

`sift` downloads on first use — a byte-range request for just the prefix it
needs, ~103 MB rather than the full 516 MB — and caches under
`research/replica_recall/data/` (already gitignored). Pre-warm it so the
download is not sitting inside a timed run:

```bash
python research/replica_recall/sift.py --vectors 200000
```

Each seed walks its own permutation of the loaded pool and samples its own
queries from SIFT's held-out query set, so the seed still resamples the whole
experiment rather than only the kill schedule. Values are scaled by 1/128 on
load: a power of two, so the mantissa is untouched and the ranking is provably
unchanged, but the magnitudes stay well inside float32. Distances are therefore
smaller than published SIFT distances by 128², and ranks are unaffected.

One sweep directory per distribution — run names carry only seed and condition,
so `aggregate.py` would otherwise pool two corpora into one meaningless number.
It refuses to, but give it separate directories anyway:

```bash
python research/replica_recall/sweep.py --seeds 5 --out-dir results_sweep_sift --dist sift
python research/replica_recall/aggregate.py --sweep-dir research/replica_recall/results_sweep_sift
```

### Asking what the damage *is* (graph forensics)

The experiment above establishes *that* failure degrades `index_recall` with
the data held constant. `graph_forensics.py` asks what the damage actually is,
by reading a replica's `index.ndb` directly — it is a dense array of 1056-byte
nodes behind a 64-byte header, so a damaged replica can be dissected offline
with no cluster running.

```bash
# one shard, or every replica side by side
python research/replica_recall/graph_forensics.py chaos_run/data --compare --link-quality 2000

# matched baseline and chaos runs, torn down before each is read
python research/replica_recall/forensics_experiment.py --seeds 3 --dist sift
```

Two things to know before trusting the output:

- **Never read a live cluster.** `element_count` lags the node bodies and links
  point at nodes not yet flushed; both look exactly like corruption. Use
  `forensics_experiment.py`, which tears each run down first.
- **`link_quality` is the semantic metric, and only differences are
  meaningful.** It scores a node's stored neighbours against the exact nearest
  neighbours among the vectors *that replica actually holds*, so it isolates
  graph quality from data completeness the way `index_recall` does. It will not
  reach 1.0 even on a healthy index — Algorithm 4's heuristic deliberately keeps
  some far neighbours for navigability — so compare replicas, never the
  absolute number.

**Result so far:** the semantic-degradation hypothesis this tool was built to
test came back negative — `link_quality` is not distinguishable between
baseline and chaos across 120 chaos replicas. But one replica out of those
120, never itself killed, lost reachability to 58.7% of its own graph while
every structural check on it looked clean. Two follow-up mechanisms were
tested (a pure-concurrency stress test, and a specific insert-path bug found
while reading the code) and both were ruled out with clean reproductions.
Root cause is still open. Full writeup:
[`postmortems/catastrophic-disconnection.md`](../postmortems/catastrophic-disconnection.md).

## The healing test (the decisive one)

A run with faults throughout measures a **steady state**: ongoing damage
balanced against whatever repair exists. It cannot distinguish "damage is
repaired as fast as it accrues" from "damage accumulates and nothing repairs
it". Those are wildly different systems, and the difference is what matters
in production.

The quiesce protocol separates them — settle, inject faults for a window,
then **stop** and keep watching:

```bash
python research/replica_recall/run_experiment.py --duration 300 --chaos-duration 120
python research/replica_recall/analyze.py          # see the QH section
```

Timeline: `--pre-chaos-s` (default 30) settling → `--chaos-duration` of faults
→ the remainder as recovery. Everything killed is restarted at the moment
chaos stops, so a still-down node cannot masquerade as a failure to heal.

Recall is the wrong metric here — it drifts with index size, and the index
grows throughout. `completeness` doesn't, and a healthy cluster holds it at
exactly 1.0000.

### The dilution trap

**But do not judge healing on `completeness` either.** It is a ratio, writes
keep flowing through the quiesce window, and a growing denominator drags it
toward 1.0 even when nothing has been recovered. From the first real run:

| phase | completeness | missing ids | n_intended |
|---|---|---|---|
| before chaos | 1.0000 | 0 | 2,791 |
| during chaos | 0.9753 | 254 | 9,143 |
| 0–30s after stop | 0.9607 | **590** | 15,009 |
| 30–60s after stop | 0.9649 | **592** | 16,881 |
| >60s after stop | 0.9694 | **592** | 19,620 |

The ratio climbs 0.9607 → 0.9694 and looks like gradual recovery. The absolute
count is flat. **Not one missed write came back** — the entire apparent
recovery is `n_intended` growing from 15,009 to 19,620.

So the verdict is computed on `missing = (1 - completeness) × n_intended`,
with damage measured at the moment faults stop (averaging over the chaos
window understates it, since early chaos has done less), and *healed*
requiring ≥90% of missed writes to actually return.

`n_intended - n_local` will **not** substitute: `n_local` includes writes too
recent to have settled, so that difference is negative on a healthy replica
(−250 in the run above).

- Missing count returns to ~0 → the system self-heals; divergence is
  transient and the thesis weakens considerably.
- Missing count stays flat → **a replica that missed writes while down never
  gets them back.** No anti-entropy, no read-repair, no catch-up. Every query
  routed there silently returns worse results, indefinitely.

### Read the result honestly

Nano-DB has **no anti-entropy mechanism, by design**. That is documented in
`cluster/coordinator_main.cpp` (see the note on `element_count` being "a
scalar proxy, not a true diff", with real reconciliation called out as a
separate effort). So a "does not heal" result here is **not the discovery of
a surprising bug** — it is a measurement of a known, deliberate scope
decision.

What is genuinely not known in advance, and what this measures:

1. **The magnitude and permanence** under a realistic failure rate — how many
   writes go permanently missing, and whether the gap closes at all.
2. **That it is completely invisible** — no error, no failed write, no
   consistency violation, and a client that lands on the degraded replica
   sees only slightly worse results forever.
3. **Whether it generalizes.** This is the important one and it is open.
   Qdrant, Milvus and Weaviate all ship replication; whether any of them
   performs anti-entropy after a replica outage is not something anyone has
   published. Pointing this harness at them is the step that would turn a
   measurement of one toy system into a contribution.

Claiming more than that from a single-system result would not survive review,
and shouldn't.

## The seed sweep (what you actually report)

A single baseline run and a single chaos run are one observation each. The
seed controls both the query set and the chaos kill schedule, so varying it
resamples the whole experiment. Nothing here should be written up from a
single pair of runs.

```bash
python research/replica_recall/sweep.py --seeds 5                  # ~60 min, 10 runs
python research/replica_recall/sweep.py --seeds 5 --with-quiesce   # adds the healing test
python research/replica_recall/aggregate.py
```

`sweep.py` is resumable — a run whose directory already holds `samples.csv`
is skipped, so an interrupted sweep restarts where it stopped. Pass `--force`
to redo everything.

`aggregate.py` reduces each run to one row of numbers and compares the
conditions with an **exact two-sided Mann-Whitney U test**. Rank-based rather
than a t-test: five runs per condition is far too few to lean on normality,
and these metrics are bounded proportions. Note the floor — with 5 vs 5 the
smallest attainable p is 2/252 = 0.0079, which means the groups separate
completely, not that the effect is large. Judge magnitude from the means, and
significance from the p.

The verdict block checks the four claims that together make the result
coherent: replicas diverge, the detector sees it, `index_recall` does *not*
differ (the graph is fine), and `completeness` does (the cause is missing
data). Any one reading `[no]` is worth understanding before writing anything.

## Validating the measurement core

The metric math is pure and tested without a cluster:

```bash
python research/replica_recall/test_metrics.py
```

The load-bearing case is `test_decomposition_separates_causes`, which builds
replicas broken in *different* ways and asserts the metrics finger the right
culprit — a replica with 70% of the data but perfect search must show
`index_recall ≈ 1.0, completeness = 0.7`, while a replica with all the data
and a bad graph must show the opposite. If that fails, every number the
experiment produces is uninterpretable.

## Files

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `metrics.py` | measurement core — pure functions, no I/O |
| `test_metrics.py` | offline validation, no cluster needed |
| `sift.py` | SIFT1M loader — byte-range fetch, fvecs parser, 1/128 scaling |
| `probe.py` | direct per-replica gRPC client |
| `run_experiment.py` | orchestration; reuses `chaos_harness.py` for process management and fault injection |
| `analyze.py` | Q0/QS/Q1–Q4 for a single run |
| `sweep.py` | runs both conditions across several seeds |
| `aggregate.py` | baseline vs chaos across seeds, with an exact rank test |
| `graph_forensics.py` | reads `index.ndb` directly — degree, reachability, in-degree, link quality |
| `forensics_experiment.py` | matched baseline/chaos runs, each dissected after teardown |

## Interpreting the output

`analyze.py` answers five questions:

- **Q0** — does recall drift over the run on its own? Q2 compares an early
  "before any kill" bucket against later ones, and early samples come from a
  smaller index. If recall declines with index growth in the **baseline**,
  Q2's gap is confounded and cannot be read as a failure effect. Always read
  Q0 on the baseline before trusting Q2.
- **Q1** — spread of `e2e_recall` across replicas of one shard at one instant.
  Non-trivial spread means two replicas answered the same queries differently
  at the same moment, and the client saw only one of them.
- **Q2** — metrics bucketed by time since the nearest kill. Recovery means
  later buckets return to the pre-kill level; a permanent step down is the
  interesting result — subject to Q0.
- **Q3** — `index_recall` vs `completeness` on the worst samples. This is the
  decomposition, and the part no existing tool reports.
- **Q4** — can `loo_agreement` pick out the degraded replica, versus chance?
  The Layer 3 test. **Compare against the baseline**: a hit rate just as high
  with no faults is measuring noise, not detection.

## Known limits

- Ground truth is brute force over the retained vector set, so this is
  practical to roughly 10⁵–10⁶ vectors on one host. It is a mechanism study,
  not a scale study.
- Both metrics that need ground truth depend on the writer retaining every
  vector it confirmed, so the experiment must drive the writes; it cannot be
  pointed at a pre-existing cluster with unknown contents.
- `chaos_harness.py` kills processes with SIGKILL, which does not lose dirty
  mmap pages. Machine-level crash consistency is a separate, unaddressed gap
  (see the durability note in the project roadmap).
- Only two shards × three replicas by default, inherited from
  `chaos_harness.py`'s topology.
