"""Tests for check_research.py. Each builds a fixture tree with ONE defect.

A checker that passes and cannot fail is worse than no checker: it looks like
coverage. So every check gets a fixture that trips it, and a matching clean
fixture that must not trip it -- the false-positive half matters as much,
because the first run of this checker produced six false alarms and a checker
that cries wolf gets switched off.

No Docker, no network, no cluster. Runs in CI beside check_index.py.

Usage:
    python research/test_check_research.py
